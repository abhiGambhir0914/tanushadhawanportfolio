                            <p>One major change in the app, was to focus on personalisation. Our aim was to
                                improve user engagement by understanding more about a user’s personal
                                preferences, allowing us to predict and tailor relevant movies & TV
                                shows to each individual user.</p>
                            <p>We also needed to create a simpler, easier and more structured way to showcase movies
                                & TV shows to users. By grouping them into categories and adding promotional features
                                within the app, we created a simple and clear hierarchy users could learn and follow.</p>
                            <p>Redesigning search allowed us to create a smarter way for users to remember what they’ve
                                previously searched for and to gather suggestions for relevant, popular
                                movies & TV shows.</p>
                            <p>Creating virtual tickets was one of the most interesting features and experiences
                                within the app. Ultimately, they’re designed to save users time and
                                frustration. With virtual tickets, we removed the need for more
                                traditional means and created an experience became more reliable
                                and user friendly than paper tickets.</p>

                            Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think
                            it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told “make
                            it look good”. That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it
                            looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
