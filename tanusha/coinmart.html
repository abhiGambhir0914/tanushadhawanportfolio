                                Bitcoin is the preeminent cryptocurrency and first to be used widely. However, hundreds of cryptocurrencies exist, and more 
                                spring into being every month. It uses cryptographic protocols or extremely complex code systems that encrypt 
                                sensitive data transfers, to secure their units of exchange. Also, they are protected by unbreakable cryptography which makes it a 
                                secure way to store wealth but also creates the risk that when a Bitcoin owners die, their digital fortune will be out of reach forever.

                                It uses the Private key for the transactions. A private key is like an unchangeable password, which is generated when you create 
                                a new cryptocurrency wallet. The key should always be kept as safe and secure as possible. Coin-base, the largest trading platform,

                                The RBI has clamped down on crypto-currencies. As part of its bi-monthly monetary policy statement, the CBI stated that with

                            Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think
                            it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told “make
                            it look good”. That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it
                            looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
